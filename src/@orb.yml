  Unofficial CircleCI orb for syncing deployments with Linear releases.

  IMPORTANT: This is an unofficial community-maintained orb and is not affiliated
  with Linear or CircleCI. Linear Release feature is in closed beta - contact
  Linear support (https://linear.app/contact) to request access. APIs may change.

  This orb wraps the linear-release CLI tool (https://github.com/linear/linear-release)
  to create, update, and complete Linear releases from your CircleCI pipelines.
